# sdcadm Changelog

## 1.12.0

-  TOOLS-1421: `sdcadm experimental volapi` to setup Volumes API service

## 1.11.1

- TOOLS-1380: 'sdcadm insts' (and other code paths) crash on gather dockerlogger instance info

## 1.11.0

- TOOLS-1359: `sdcadm` no longer logs JSON-formatted bunyan logs to `stderr`,
  preferring instead to emit actionable information formatted for human
  readability.  The log data is still available in `/var/log/sdcadm`.
- TOOLS-1342: `sdcadm` now correctly respects longer execution timeouts
  for agent updates and docker deployments.
- TOOLS-1367: `sdcadm` now connects more reliably to RabbitMQ when
  communicating with remote `ur` agents.
- TOOLS-1335: `sdcadm` will now retry DNS resolution for SAPI updates,
  avoiding one failure mode for any service updated immediately after
  a `binder` update.

## 1.10.0

- TOOLS-1323: Split `sdcadm dc-maint` command into three subcommands due
  to incompatible options for each one of the tasks this command was trying
  to perform: start/stop and display DC maintenance status.
- TOOLS-1326: Do not exit when there's an unknown service in SAPI, just warn
  about it.

## 1.9.2

- TOOLS-1301: sdcadm update cannot call method reprovFailLock_Lock of undefined
- TOOLS-1320: "sdcadm update dockerlogger" failed against multiple CNs
- TOOLS-1318: Added `--message` and `--eta` options to `dc-maint --start`
- TOOLS-1324: Added `--docker-only` and `--cloudapi-only` options to
  `dc-maint --start`.

## 1.9.1

- TOOLS-1311: Updated to latest `cmdln` and `dashdash` for better CLI
  completion.

## 1.9.0

- TOOLS-1298: Support for Underlay NICs provided by aggregations for `sdcadm
  post-setup underlay-nics`
- TOOLS-1219: `sdcadm experimental update dockerlogger` will install/update
  dockerlogger service into setup servers.
- TOOLS-1025: Use newest `manatee-adm` subcommands when possible.

## 1.8.7

- TOOLS-1293: Increase the timeout for the agents install step of `sdcadm
  experimental update-agents` to 20 minutes (from 10).

## 1.8.6

- TOOLS-1223: Set canmount=noauto for `zones/$ZONE_UUID/data/manatee` dataset
  when setting to something else.
- TOOLS-1287: Renamed `sdcadm post-setup zookeeper` to
  `sdcadm post-setup ha-binder` in order to make clear what type of VMs the
  command will create.
- TOOLS-1121: `sdcadm update manatee` doesn't use the "sleep(60)" anymore and,
  instead, uses waitForInstToBeUp properly.
- TOOLS-1289: Improved error messages when sysinfo-refresh fails for one or
  more servers during agents update.
- TOOLS-1076: Fixed help message for `post-setup zookeeper/binder`.
- TOOLS-1191: Fixed PostgreSQL availability check.

## 1.8.5

- TOOLS-905: Move `dc-maint` out of `experimental`. Now should be used just as
  `sdcadm dc-maint [options]`.
- TOOLS-1187: Fixed `sdcadm update manatee` not properly freezing shard for
  updates.

## 1.8.4

- TOOLS-1277: `sdcadm experimental cns` to setup the CNS service and instance,
  and `sdcadm up cns` to update. Note: Eventually this will move to either
  post-setup or being a default created service.

## 1.8.3

- TOOLS-1269: Always force `no_rabit=true` when updating agents

## 1.8.2

- TOOLS-1172: Reject `sdcadm up <unknown svc or inst>` with error msg
- TOOLS-1239: Prevent `sdcadm up <svc>@<UUID of different svc image>`
- TOOLS-1173: Fixed support for `sdcadm up <svc>@<version>`
- TOOLS-1074: Added bash completion

## 1.8.1

- TOOLS-1264/TOOLS-563: Moved sdcadm subcommands to their own files and added
  `sdcadm experimental update` and `scdadm experimental avail` which can handle
  individual updates (and availability) of vm, cn and net agents.
- TOOLS-1252: `sdcadm avail sdcadm` and `sdcadm avail` will now include
  `sdcadm` available images without adding `sdcadm` to SAPI services.
  (This may be modified in the future).

## 1.8.0

- TOOLS-1251: `sdcadm self-update` no longer updates to latest sdcadm available
  image and requires either a given image UUID or `--latest` option to be
  provided.

## 1.7.5

- TOOLS-1246: sdcadm commands would break due to bad sshpk 1.5.0 release

## 1.7.4

- TOOLS-1225 Drop confusing `-x,--exclude SERVERS` options on `sdcadm
  experimental update-agents ...` and `sdcadm platform assign ...`.  Also a
  number of robustness improvements to `sdcadm experimental update-agents`.

## 1.7.3

- TOOLS-1167/TOOLS-1166: sdcadm ex update-agents now updates node.config
  in all CNs, has limited concurrency and agentsshar file download and
  execution are now two separated steps
- TOOLS-1236: 'sdcadm avail' doesn't need to print out channel info
- TOOLS-1234: 'sdcadm post-setup underlay-nics -h' for help doesn't work
- TOOLS-1031: 'sdcadm post-setup underlay-nics' verifies that CNs have the
  configured fabric underlay network tag assigned to any actual nic before
  trying to add them an otherwise useless underlay nic.

## 1.7.2

- Implemented changes from https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0009:
  Replaced `sdcadm experimental fabrics` + `sdcadm experimental portolan` with
  `sdcadm post-setup fabrics`. Dropped support for `--coal` option and added
  documentation about how to setup fabrics in CoaL to SDC's developers guide
  (https://github.com/joyent/sdc/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/coal-post-setup-fabrics.md).
- Get `sdcadm experimental default-fabric` out of experimental, i.e. now is
  `sdcadm default-fabric`.

## 1.7.1

- Deprecated 'latest' symlink for platforms
- Added `sdcadm platform set-default PLATFORM` subcommand
- Include default platform column in `sdcadm platform list`
- Added `sdcadm platform assign --latest`

## 1.7.0

- TOOLS-754: http_proxy support. If your SDC is firewalled of, but you
  have an HTTP proxy that can be used to given `sdcadm` (and IMGAPI)
  external access, then sdcadm can work with that.

        sapiadm update $(sdc-sapi /applications?name=sdc | json -H 0.uuid) \
            metadata.http_proxy=http://my-proxy.example.com:8080

  Then after a minute or two (to allow config-agents to update configurations
  appropriately) you should be able to 'sdcadm up ...' et al via
  that proxy.

  A side-effect of this change is that programmatic usage of "lib/sdcadm.js"
  must explicitly finialize the `SdcAdm` instance:

        var SdcAdm = require('./lib/sdcadm');
        var adm = new SdcAdm({...});
        // ...
        adm.fini();

## 1.6.1

- `sdcadm experimental udpate-agents` now runs its own Ur Queue, instead of
  passing a script to each CN using sdc-oneachnode. Command options have been
  modified accordingly.

## 1.6.0

- Changed the behaviour of `sdcadm update --all --force-rabbitmq` and
  `sdcadm update --all --force-data-path` to allow updating of rabbitmq
  and portolan (currently the sole "data path" service) along with the
  usual `--all` services.
